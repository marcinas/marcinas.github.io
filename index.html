			/*******************************************************************************
			 * TO-DO				short term, to be completed by April 2017
			 *******************************************************************************
			 	all done :)
			 ******************************************************************************/



			/*******************************************************************************
			 * TO-SOMEDAY-DO	  long term, to be completed next research/development cycle
			 *******************************************************************************

			 	add popup that triggers first time low fps encountered, pauses and asks (do you want to continue running sim?)
				add frame-rate limit to prevent slowdown during very fast simulations (where statistics calcs are the bottleneck)
			 	write function to gather monad info in CSV format for every # of frames
					write to text file the logs
			 	revise basic.takeSnapshot() to also take snapshot of statistics screen and controls fully opened
				 	also re-enable under certain circumstances
			 	track broken bonds
				indicator for displacement/capacity
				basic.debug(): check what prints on all combinations:
					null values, undefined, 0, strings, arrays, array of strings, etc. 
					possible add new function as well: stringify() which has different instructions for each data type
			 	monad.bounce() should have more research on how interactions work
			 	split monad.qunata.countdown into color only variable and actual escape tracking variable separately
				 	move countdown and mountdown to color (see also new color scheme idea, somewhere below)
			 	monad.getToroidDistanceTo(): in if (x1 || y1 || z1 || x2 || y2 || z2)
				 	optimize by only cycling through appropriate zones (check zone intersection code)
			 	monad.checkBond(): in //get raw distance and weighted speed,
				 	what about max speed check? why only check < 1?
					should we have it less than 1? why? other than obvious fact of speed too fast to bond?
				fix energy loss for merge-only simulations:
					monad-monad-collision doesn't re-absorb the absorbed monad's quanta 
					(they are lost on reabsorption stage once their count is reached)
			 	for monad.spaceDistanceTo(), find formula to always give perfect distance in toroid world (right now is just while loop)
			 	when merging particles, if debug chosen index particle is nullified, change debug index to new particle index
			    for exceeding max speed and bonding manipulations, add controls to control cost of extra excess quanta.e emissions
				for statistics update, fill in more || 0 or NaN values to avoid weird results 
					change bad values to negative? be careful of || though!! 0 is valid
					stress test originally had funny values for polarity and size distribution (it doesn't appear to currently)
			 	change monad research to record also distances for limited number of first particles
				 	(i.e., 0/2, 1/2, 0/3, 1/3, 2/3, 0/4, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4)
					or make dynamic so can scale so that all particle's distances/charges are measured
					similarly update controls.world.strict settings so that all particles are equidistant
				multiple textures for positive/negative particles (alternative to color-neutral mode)
					maybe just a plus + on positives; minus - on negatives 
				add button to make all particles red or blue
					maybe a slider of color polarization? the more, the more red and blue particles will appear
				take pictures of statistics information
				z-indexing so layer is controls -> statistics -> simulation
			 	checkout how to avoid javascript runtime violations (mostly from loops taking too long)
			 	write collision and other looping to be parallel processed (changed emphasis to one super-fast simulation 
				 	rather than many fast simulations)
			 	check if added and constantly monitoring a .mass composition (similar to radius) in monad
				 	affects runtime (currently, radius is always accurate but mass must be obtained from
					 	adding attractons and repulsons whenever desired)
			 	if possible to do and not slow simulation down: find a way to store double+ sets of
				 	information in each monad in order to:
					 	process every monad mathematically simultaneously (in the current system, if monads A, B, and C exist in the simulation and
						 	have overlapping boundaries such that A is overlapping with B and B is overlapping with C (but A and C do not overlap)
						 	within a single tick, there are rare but possible difference that can arise, say by: e.g. the overlaps being the barest
							fractions of overlaps, merging being enabled but not bonding, and monad A is processed first, so it is merged with monad
							B, creating an updated bigger monad positioned between the former monad A and monad B; monad B will not be processed because
							it has merged; when monad C is processed, it will no longer be barely overlapping with monad B, and thus a potential
							missed collision may occur)
						process all statistics in same quantum step
						analyze multiple event chaining (see the first argument above about simultaneous mathematics) in a way that ensures at least
							for one quantum time step, there are no discrepancies based on monad order of processing
			 	change colorCharge panel to be fully transparent except for red and blue and purpleness?
				 	this way user can drag camera over it to have a monad right up against the color scale
			  	add ability to download entire monad and settings dataset (all positions, velocities, etc.)
				  	can re-upload dataset into simulation 
				  	idea would be to be able to pause simulation, download, and resume another day or another computer
					this way can create lots of very unique setups just from data and load them into simulation
			 	color-neutral mode: have different distance effect (darkness won't do--maybe purpleness?)
			 	relabel all of these quanta stuff with actual words...
					update [terminology] working to attracton/repulson
						i think this means change n/p -/+ to r/a
			 	checkout cache/binding (see research todo and notes.txt)
				run enough tests on mass to find minimum mass on scaled world size that blues connected to blues near 100%
			 	keep doing what you're doing, describing model, etc. but come up with an experiment
				 	can be large scale (we ran 100 experiments on blue--they merged 95% of the time, etc.)
					or can treat it like: we created this simulation to see what would happen
						and here are some of our observations
					story part one: show (if massive enough) blue-blue and red-red combined
					story part two: the shapes in bonding (tetrahedral, lines) think orange packing
						two reds, two blues, one red, one blue, three reds, three blues (100%)
							cvs of distance over time
								averaged out over time to smooth anomalies (e.g. do blues really separate before uniting)
						new checkbox for absolute median ? (also check deviation calculations)
				make a Data object JSON (every object is string that can be saved) probably of emergence object or statistics object
					check out MCGB2 database dump lines 328-386 fishnut.js
					send email to M to set up/show database
					in case of crash: every run being over, just upload the data
						think data storage (as in, for a 3000 tick simulation, just export as csvs with titles)
			 	make toroid have options:
					toroid (already done)
					bounce off wall
					repel reverse direction
					toroid but warp opposite
					vanishing point--particles disappear beyond box
						can also do simple radius from center
			 	add trails behind monads
			    consider rewriting ToroidDISTANCE if these are always same arguments (will need to check Zones.getcollisioninzone to see how gettoroiddistance used there)
			 	change colors so that user can pick which of red,green,blue is positive and negative
				add 26 cube copies of the environment around the central environment (like 26 toroid mirrors)
					have them fade from transparent to nothing within a few zones of the edge, so near to the edge,
						monads are visible in all their edge/corner locations, full opaque in central sim and transparent in side ones
			 	add save and load of controls settings
					 (see https://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#5--Saving-Values)
					 ALL CAPS in controls should be eliminated or integrated into presets
			 	tooltips for all controls and settings
			 	redo monad colors to have base color, over-color, and toggle to decide whether to use base or over
					base color will always be red-blue spectrum with whiteout settings?
					over-color will be collision, emission, bonding, etc. colors
			 	check how new bonding and merging models will affect quantamerge
				 	e.g. do experiments and watch to make sure results look 'normal'
					 	single-quanta should always be absorbed
				add effects that smaller particles have lower thresholds (distance?) for merging into
					a big particle they are bonded with
				rewrite collision-bonding mechanisms to ideally get bonding behavior without bonding arrays
					e.g. just have particles try to avoid intersections? bouncing? shooting a/r into other monad?
			 	line between two clicked particles
					line between two particles that have exchanged quanta
					line between two particles that are bonded
			 	rewrite bounce rules for monad-monad non-bonding (right now always adds vectors for attractons > repulsons)
			 	full color multi-layered histograms
				 	like each rainbow color has a meaning, multiple transparent layers
					extra lines and points like trendlines, local maxima, minima...
					for log scale, just take log... duh
					e.g. histogram of all monads:  sizes, charges, total emitted, bonded, speed, all in one chart
			 	collision
				 	redo to ray-casting collision (allows higher max speed but needs complete rewrite of zones and maybe monad)
					bonding:
					WHEN BONDed, emission does not collide until it leaves volume of all bonded monads
						once it leaves, it can collide, even with itself
			 	workaround chrome bug:
				 	GL_INVALID_OPERATION : glGenSyncTokenCHROMIUM: fence sync must be flushed before generating sync token
					WebGL: CONTEXT_LOST_WEBGL: loseContext: context lost
				fix: bonding over toroid edges
				maybe write photo taker or video taker
				finish alpha-beta version cataloging
				cleanup initialization to make faster
				crossover bigger regions than 3x3x3 cube? (right now just scales up to 5x5x5, 7x7x7, etc.)
				maybe particles warp space around them (use zones to record stability)
				use attraction fields in zones for aggregate data to visualize (e.g., every zone has a color)
				if feel missed collisions
					try shadowing past movements or using ray collisions if movement exceeds radius in one frame
				future: imagine structures... +/- arrangement (what do they look like internally?)
				add bouncing, elastic collisions
				new universe option: toroidal sphere....
				toggle for 'gravitational' attraction to center
				okay, so each monad has two impact points:
				a red and blue vector
					when a new collision occurs, the blue portion of the impact	is weighted and combined with the blue vector
						same with red
					when emitting, the red or blue quanta determines which impact vector it will use
					all direction is a combination of the red and blue vector weighted
					thus, on impact, blue and/or red vector is altered, and net velocity re-adjusted
					could also have impact region (?)

				COMMENTS/CLEANUP: FULLY DONE (COMMENTED, VARIABLE RENAME and LINE COMMNETS and CLEAR JUNK CODE):
					emergence_simulation.html
					controls.js
					readme.txt
					basic.js
					zones.js
					monad.js
					statistics.js
					emergence.js
				spellcheck, etc.
				get rest of to-do list from readme
				add banner to top
				cleanup takeSnapshot function but leave disabled
 				CHECK ALL TO-DOs in all code and either do them or place them here or in to-someday-do
				 	individual line TODOs gone through and either done, moved to to-someday-do, or scrapped
				add [optional parameter] brackets to javascript documentation
			 	color neutral: reload charge colors and other stats charts/panels to match scheme
			  	have a new simulation that's loaded while in pause advance a single tick (resets the stats)
			 	change hash options to drop-down menu
				 	since stress test, monad research, and clump mode can't overlap
					 leave debugInit as checkbox
				bonds don't get removed on super merges (many heavy particles in center at generation)
				collision checking fix for if combined radius is bigger than size (getToroidDistanceTo will negative numbers)
				change 'collision' to 'merging' unless it actually checks for all interaction upon collision
			    option to not keep bonding constant--just always nudge away from overlap
			 	add sliders and toggles for bonding settings
			 	collision colors flash
			 	every collision per time step determines probability of impact-based emission (both by polarity and direction)
					average or keep array of impacts and choose randomly from it
			 	for < 200 datapoints, have statistics floor the calculated number (won't cut off half then)
				 	only needed for msd
			 	investigate:
					sometimes pausing (pressing ;) if near a restart will cause two-monad tests to rapidly restart
					sometimes quanta and monads timelapse charts will have a single line much higher or lower than others
			 	further statistics cleanup:
					left panel instant stuff (fps,ms,mb,em,col,noise,unalter)
					left panel current stuff (quanta,monads,temp,dist,other time values, -msd)
					bottom panel timelapse stuff (current - msd +monad size dist., change final value to average
					ax: particle count, average monad mass, instability
				color-blind mode (black negative, white positive, gray neutral, red background, distance by amount of background color mixed in?)
			 	added confirmation before closing browser window (prevents accidental experiment end)
				bug: particle boxes don't toroid warp (they continue into empty space)
				add run id number for mass number testing
				bugfix: screen height and width change particle size appearance
				bugfix: getToroidDistanceTo Incorrect (see bonding over toroid walls)
					multiple collisions over a few frames with just 2 particles? see Run 3: -1490353990040.log
			 	look for
					motion and interaction between two big particles
						small rom, big room
				possible bug: when changing visualization (showRadiation), it causes a collision (perhaps resetting monads?)
			 	new bonding mechanisms (local only, positional based)
					each monad attempts to readjust any bonded particle not immediately next to it
					it can only move the particle up to both of the particles speeds weighted by mass
					if it cannot move the particle all of the way, the remaining distance is converted
						to excess (similar to converting max speed to excess) and quanta is emitted to conserve energy
				major bugfix: reabsorption loss fix (particles leave the timeslots stream and particles reabsorb before emission)
			 	write different color for monad-monad collision
				impact % charge or emission can be scaled (e.g. 1 quanta does 20 quanta worth of impact--monads move faster)
				similarly, possibly add averaged position when collide
					(i.e., the position of new bigger particle is the average of the two colliding particles)
				oob re-design to check all 8 possible toroid wraps
 				fix mpolarity, charge, polarity in statistics (pretty much all get very strange in non-strange conditions)
					mpolarity gets negative; cloud charge get negative on stress test; etc. 
			 	graph showing both quanta and monads and positive/negative using colors
			 	add switch to turn off collision/emission colors
				debug crossover (it's still not getting particles next door--see last screenshot)
			 	clear quanta button
				fix clicky mouse
				recycle quanta instead of displace (lost quanta is readded (without velocity affects) to originator monad)
				create enforceMass control
					switch setup so that if ever the number of possible rendered particles reaches max and another needs to generate,
					the farthest away, longest timed particle existence is replaced with the new emission
						this will allow up to 1000s of high mass particles to interact and have a combined mass much higher than that of total renderable particles
				make decay rate exponential
				give every simulation an ID so it's easy to check prior photos
				add a timer to show how long simulations are running
				if possible w/ firefox
					wrap code in anonymous functions
					(function(window) {
					//all code in your file goes here
					})(window);
				create graph function that takes in a lot of versatile data
					dynamic so can get all sorts of data
					maybe even during simulation
						log plot and histograms for largest particle
				add a print report button that prints a few frames of automatic debug material
				use webform to put in constants
				mass relates to volume/radius (oranges problem/ spheres)
				for emission, place emitted particle on the sphere surface + 1 
					fixed speed use maxspeed
						emitted particle should be the fastest thing in system
				neg/pos maybe affect vectors (pos/neg)
				based on composition of particles, bouncing, bonding, merging with activation energies as well?
				emission based on kicking out the minority particle
				add toroid opposite end warp switch
				add toggle for whether p/n actually effect each other
				decide how lighting works (can be based on neighbors total, mass, etc.)
					same for color, shape, maybe even transparency
				bug fix (one emission with two components, split/emit and will they merge again?)
					check on fixed vector--observe interaction
				use webgl or three.js, up to you, will optimize better
					optimize graphics
				probability per tick of emission
				attraction vs repulsion
					no rules of attraction and repulsion (no cycling)
					just emit positives/negatives and collisions affect trajectory
					more like seeing if attraction/repulsion emerges
				goal:
					color of sphere changing floating around in space
					toroidal
				2nd goal:
					spheres collides
					color based on ratio of +/-
					3d canvas
					100 particle minimum, 1000s preferred
